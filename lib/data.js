    "Welcome to Tea@Columbia, a listing of awesome people you should meet before they graduate. Columbia's chock-full of amazingly talented people and it's pretty hard to meet all of them during your four years here. Many of us are graduating in a few months and this is our last semester to meet you and it's your last chance to meet us barring fortuitous future encounters. So let's make the most of our time here and try to make as many friends as we can in the short time we have left.\n\nIf you're a senior and want to pass on your words of wisdom to young padawans or are looking to have a deep conversation over a hot cup of cocoa with other seniors, please create an account and share your profile on this site.\nIf you're not a senior, please reach out to all these great people who want to talk with you.\n\nThanks teawithtanay.com for inspiring this project.\n\n-- Parthi, SEAS'16"
