    "Columbia has a lot of really amazing people and a lot of us want to get to know each other. But meeting strangers is scary and it's hard to find people who want to meet you. So to help you, here's Coffee at Columbia, a public listing of students open to meeting up. Feel free to ping the awesome people below for a coffee, tea, hot cocoa or your beverage of choice. Alternatively, if you want to have people reach out to you, create a profile!<br/><br/>" +
